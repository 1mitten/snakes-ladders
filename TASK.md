Build the core engine for a Snakes and Ladders board game. You do not need a UI; focus entirely on the domain logic and state transitions.

🎲 General Rules

The board has 100 squares, starting at 1 and ending at 100.
Players take turns rolling a 6-sided die (numbered 1–6).
A player must land exactly on square 100 to win.

Feature 1: Starting & Moving

Focus on basic player setup and basic movements without any obstacles.

Test 1.1: A new game starts with Player 1 and Player 2 on Square 1.
Test 1.2: Given Player 1 is on Square 1, when they roll a 4, they should land on Square 5.
Test 1.3: Given Player 1 is on Square 1, when they roll a 3 and then a 4, they should land on Square 8.
Feature 2: Winning the Game

Handle the end-game condition and exact roll rules.

Test 2.1: Given Player 1 is on Square 97, when they roll a 3, they land on Square 100 and the game declares Player 1 wins.
Test 2.2: Given Player 1 is on Square 97, when they roll a 4, they bounce off the end and land back on Square 99 (100 minus the remaining moves).
Test 2.3: Given a player has won, any further rolls or turns are ignored / not allowed.
Feature 3: Turns & Multiple Players

Manage the flow of the game between players.

Test 3.1: After Player 1 rolls, it is Player 2's turn.
Test 3.2: After Player 2 rolls, the turn cycles back to Player 1.
Test 3.3: Ensure players track their positions independently (e.g., Player 1 rolling a 3 doesn't affect Player 2's position).

There is also a Feature 4, but this is to be done in the interview itself is to implement as mentioned, so we’d expect the code only to cover the first 3 features.

This is not intended to be a task that deals with complex UI or design, it is more the core engine and logic that’s important. We are leaving the implementation design completely up to you on how you approach the problem.
